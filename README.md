TaskTide is a website that takes your class schedule input and arranges it for you. Other features include
color coding to visually organize your week and an AI assistant. This AI assistant takes the input of your 
schedule and recommends study habits/study blocks, comments on the nature of your schedule, and more.

Other features include a timer. In order to track the amount of time spent studying for certain subjects, 
the user is able to select the class for which they are studying for, starting and stopping the timer 
at the appropriate time. This allows the user to monitor their progress and ensure they are spending
enough time on their topics.

The final feature is the insight page. Based on data such as your schedule arrangement and the amount of
time you spend studying for your subjects, the insight page will generate a chart. It will also provide 
the toal times spend studying for each subject that week.
